# Intro
This is my personal web site, in which I want to put some of the interesting things I've worked on in a while.

# Architecture
I wanted to do hands-on work in this architecture avoiding the boring "portfolio website" or "curriculum vitae web site". I wanted to do something different. And that's it, something different, a DevOps inspired, IaC inspired, microservice architecture. A very fun implementation of a boring personal web site.
